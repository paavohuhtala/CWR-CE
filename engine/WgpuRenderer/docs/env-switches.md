# WGPU renderer environment switches

Generated from the code on 2026-08-02 by scanning `getenv` / `env::var` call
sites under `engine/WgpuRenderer/`. **30 switches** exist across the C++ bridge
and the Rust renderer.

## Read this first

Eight of these were **inert until `9fb2e47`**. `ConfigureWgpuUltraEnvironment()`
in `apps/cwr/Game/GameApplication.cpp` applied its profile with `_putenv_s`,
which overwrites, and it runs before renderer creation reads the variables — so
setting any of the eight had no effect whatsoever. They are now applied as
defaults, so an explicit value wins and the shipped profile is unchanged.

If you are reading an older report or commit that claims one of these was used
to test something, treat the claim with suspicion: before `9fb2e47` it could not
have been.

## Inventory

| Switch | Read by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WGR_GPU_WATER` | C++ bridge | **Was inert.** `0` leaves the water renderer unbuilt; `Landscape::DrawWater` then falls through to the legacy per-segment mesh. |
| `WGR_WATER_FFT` | Rust | **Was inert.** |
| `WGR_HDR` | C++ bridge + Rust | **Was inert.** |
| `WGR_MSAA` | Rust | **Was inert.** |
| `WGR_PREPASS` | Rust | **Was inert.** |
| `WGR_INDIRECT` | Rust | **Was inert.** |
| `WGR_GPU_DRIVEN` | C++ bridge + Rust | **Was inert.** |
| `WGR_SHADOW_MAPS` | C++ bridge | **Was inert.** Cascaded shadow maps at startup. |
| `WGR_HDR_ENCODE` | C++ bridge | |
| `WGR_TONEMAP` | C++ bridge | |
| `WGR_EXPOSURE` | C++ bridge | |
| `WGR_CONFORM_DEBUG` | C++ bridge | |
| `WGR_GRASS_TUFT` | C++ bridge | |
| `WGR_SW_ZBIAS_MULT` | C++ bridge | |
| `WGR_GRASS` | Rust | |
| `WGR_GRASS_DENSITY` | Rust | |
| `WGR_GRASS_DISTANCE` | Rust | |
| `WGR_FOLIAGE_A2C` | Rust | Alpha-to-coverage for foliage. |
| `WGR_SKIN_BAKE` | Rust | Compute skin bake; default off. |
| `WGR_GPU_OCCLUSION` | Rust | |
| `WGR_GPU_VALIDATION` | Rust | |
| `WGR_CULL_NO_FRUSTUM` | Rust | Disables frustum culling (debug). |
| `WGR_SKY_DEBUG` | Rust | |
| `WGR_SKY_VIS_DEBUG` | Rust | |
| `WGR_TERRAIN_BLEND_WIDTH` | Rust | |
| `WGR_TERRAIN_SHADOW_SCALE` | Rust | |
| `WGR_TERRAIN_SHADOW_STEPS` | Rust | |
| `WGR_TERRAIN_SHADOW_PENUMBRA` | Rust | |
| `WGR_TERRAIN_SKIRT_K` | Rust | |
| `WGR_WATER_SKIRT_K` | Rust | |

## Regenerating

This table is derived, not maintained by hand. Re-scan with:

```bash
grep -rhoE '(getenv|env::var|var)\("WGR_[A-Z_0-9]+"' engine/WgpuRenderer/ \
  | grep -oE 'WGR_[A-Z_0-9]+' | sort -u
```

A switch that appears in the code but not here means the table is stale — which
is the failure mode `RND-030` found throughout this repository's renderer
documentation, so prefer the scan over the table when they disagree.
