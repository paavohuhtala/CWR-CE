# Screen-space ambient occlusion (GTAO) plan — MSAA-compatible, no TAA

**Renderer:** `engine/WgpuRenderer` (wgpu-native, Rust). **Status:** PLAN (2026-07-12).

## 0. The governing constraint: MSAA, not TAA

This engine anti-aliases with **MSAA** (`WGR_MSAA`, default 4×, HDR-gated) and has **no temporal
accumulation**. That single fact dictates the whole AO design, because the modern GTAO recipe is built
on TAA:

- Canonical GTAO spends a *tiny* per-frame budget (often **one** azimuthal slice) and relies on TAA to
  accumulate slices across frames + denoise the per-pixel dither. **We cannot do that.** Every frame
  must stand on its own.
- Therefore: **enough samples per frame to be stable**, + a **spatial (bilateral) denoise**, + a
  purely **spatial** dither chosen so the blur removes it. No temporal reprojection, no history buffer,
  no "rotate the slice by frame index." A ghost-free still *and* a ghost-free pan both fall out for
  free because nothing is temporal.
- This is the pre-TAA HBAO+blur playbook, updated to GTAO's cosine-correct integral + bent normal. At
  OFP's scene complexity the extra per-frame cost is affordable (see §9).

Everything below is written to that constraint. Where a choice exists, the temporally-stable option
wins even at some GPU cost.

## 1. Why add it (and how it splits with sky-visibility)

The baked **terrain sky-visibility** ([sky-visibility-ambient-plan.md](sky-visibility-ambient-plan.md))
is a *large-scale, positional, concave-only* AO: it darkens gorges/cove-beds/cliff-bases and nothing
else, because rolling terrain has a sky-view factor ≈ 1 and it can never brighten a convex ridge or
resolve a local fold. Screen-space AO covers the **complementary band**:

| | terrain sky-vis (baked) | GTAO (screen-space) |
|---|---|---|
| Range | far / km-scale, incl. **under-terrain** | short–medium (world-space radius) |
| Sees | the heightfield only | **everything in the depth buffer**: object↔terrain contact, rocks, foliage grounding, local folds |
| Occluders off-screen | yes | no (screen-space blind spot) |
| Bent normal | no (Stage-2 refinement) | **yes** → directional ambient |

They are disjoint, so they **compose** (multiply visibilities / min), not compete. GTAO supplies the
"shaded terrain has form" and "objects sit in the world" that sky-vis structurally cannot. Its bent
normal redirects the existing SH sky-irradiance ambient (`frame::sky_irradiance`), which is the direct
answer to "shaded slopes look flat."

## 1a. Prerequisite audit (2026-08-03) — verified against the branch

Checked before starting, because this plan's assumptions are older than the branch and
the neighbouring plans turned out to be wrong in both directions (see
[`RND-030-renderer-consolidation-20260803.md`](../../../docs/roadmap/decisions/RND-030-renderer-consolidation-20260803.md)).

| Assumption in this plan | Verified state |
| --- | --- |
| The depth+normal prepass exists and runs | **True, and unconditional.** `prepass_enabled` defaults `true`; `WGR_PREPASS=0` is a dev A/B only. Its plan claims "Stages 0/2/3 still planned" — Stage 2 is in fact complete. |
| Single-sample nearest-resolved depth already exists — reuse it | **True.** `depth_sample_view` (`gfx3d/mod.rs:1203`), fed by `DepthResolve` with `reduce_far:false`. At 1× it is the prepass depth aspect directly. Do not add a depth resolve. |
| The normal target is `Rg16Float`, oct-encoded | **True.** `NORMAL_FORMAT`, written by the object and terrain prepass fragments via `gbuffer::oct_encode`. |
| The normal target is MSAA and **not** resolved | **True — still the one missing input.** `wgr_3d_normal` is created with `sample_count: self.sample_count` and only `RENDER_ATTACHMENT \| TEXTURE_BINDING`; there is no `normal_resolve` / `NormalResolve` anywhere in the tree. |
| MSAA is actually on in the shipped client | **Yes, 4×** — confirmed by the renderer's own startup line: `[wgr] effective gates: … msaa=4x`. So the MSAA path is the default path, not the exotic one, and the normal resolve is required work rather than an edge case. |
| `@binding(10)` sky-vis is the pattern to copy for `@binding(11)` | **True.** `terrain_skyvis_mask` at `frame.wgsl:125`, with the matching layout and bind-builder entries in `gfx3d/mod.rs` (~566 and ~716) — both must be extended, which is the step the plan warns ate two positional-arg ABI bugs. |

**Consequence:** the only prerequisite that does not already exist is the single-sample
normal. Stage 1 should open with that resolve, and the plan's own advice — take **sample 0**
rather than averaging oct-encoded normals, since a raw texel average is wrong across the
oct wrap — stands.

**Do not** start Stage 1 by extending `@binding(11)` first. The frame UBO group is shared by
every 3D pipeline; a layout change with no producer bound is a validation error in every pass
at once. Build the resolve, then the GTAO compute writing to a texture nothing samples, then
wire the binding and the consumers last.

## 2. Inputs — already produced by the prepass

The unconditional depth+normal prepass ([depth-prepass-plan.md](depth-prepass-plan.md)) was built as
the "SSAO normal G-buffer"; its outputs are exactly GTAO's inputs. Availability differs by MSAA state:

- **Depth (view/linearizable).** Single-sample **nearest-resolved** depth already exists:
  `depth_resolve` → `depth_sample_view` (`Depth32Float`), created for Hi-Z (`gfx3d/mod.rs` DepthResolve,
  `reduce_far:false` = nearest = the closest/front surface, which is what AO wants). On the 1× path the
  prepass depth is already single-sample. **Reuse this; do not add a depth resolve.**
- **View-space normal.** `NORMAL_FORMAT = Rg16Float`, oct-encoded (`gbuffer::oct_encode`), written by
  `fs_terrain_prepass` + the object prepass. **But the normal target is MSAA (`count: sample_count`)
  and is *not* resolved today.** GTAO runs per-pixel, so it needs a single-sample normal:
  - 1× path: the prepass normal is already single-sample — use directly.
  - MSAA path: **add a one-off normal resolve** (a tiny fullscreen/compute pass mirroring `DepthResolve`)
    writing a single-sample `Rg16Float`. Resolving oct-encoded normals: decode → average sample dirs →
    renormalize → re-encode (a raw texel average of oct codes is wrong across the wrap). Cheapest
    correct-enough variant: just take **sample 0** (per-pixel AO tolerates it; the bilateral blur hides
    the rest). Start with sample-0; upgrade to a proper average only if edges shimmer.

No new geometry passes — only (MSAA-only) a normal resolve.

## 3. The GTAO pass

A compute pass, dispatched after the prepass + its resolves, before the forward colour pass. Output:
a single-sample AO texture (Stage 1) and later a bent-normal texture (Stage 2), at render resolution
(or half, §4).

Per pixel, in view space (reconstruct position from depth + `inv_view_proj`/the projection params):

1. **Slices.** Pick `S` azimuthal directions in screen space (start `S=2–3`; no temporal rotation, so
   this is the per-frame azimuthal resolution). Rotate the whole slice set by a per-pixel **interleaved
   gradient noise** angle (spatial dither the blur removes) + offset the step start (spatial), no frame
   term.
2. **Horizon search.** For each slice, march `N` steps (start `N=8–12`) left and right within a
   world-space `radius` projected to screen; at each tap read depth, form the view-space sample, track
   the **max horizon angle** each side (cos of the angle to the horizon). A **thickness/falloff**
   heuristic rejects thin foreground occluders (the classic GTAO "sky over a thin pole" fix) and a
   distance falloff bounds the radius.
3. **Integrate.** GTAO's ground-truth per-slice integral (the arc-cosine cosine-weighted term between
   the two horizons, projected onto the pixel normal) → per-slice visibility. Average over slices.
   Optionally apply the GTAO **multi-bounce** darkening-compensation curve (a cheap per-pixel polynomial
   in albedo luminance) to fake interreflection instead of crushing to black.
4. **Bent normal (Stage 2).** Accumulate the per-slice unoccluded-direction vector; normalize → the
   average visible direction. This is the payload that makes shaded slopes directional (§6).

Radius is world-space (so AO is scale-stable), clamped to a max screen radius for cost. Reconstruct
view-space Z by linearizing the reversed-Z depth with the projection constants already in the frame
UBO.

## 4. Denoise WITHOUT TAA

The whole denoise budget is spatial. Three composable levers:

1. **Per-frame sample budget.** `S` slices × `N` steps must be *enough on their own*. `S=3, N=10` +
   IGN rotation is the pre-TAA HBAO sweet spot: noisy at the pixel level, but low-frequency once
   blurred. Tune up if banding shows; we have the headroom (§9).
2. **Bilateral blur** — the load-bearing step. A separable, **depth- and normal-aware** blur (weights
   fall off with view-Z difference and normal divergence) over ~4–8 px. Wide enough to erase the IGN
   dither, edge-aware enough not to bleed AO across silhouettes or crease normals. This replaces the
   temporal denoise entirely. Runs on the single-sample AO texture (cheap).
3. **Optional half-resolution + bilateral upsample** (perf lever, §9). Compute AO at ½×½, then a
   depth-aware joint-bilateral upsample to full res. AO is low-frequency so half-res is visually
   ~free; the upsample must be depth-aware to keep MSAA'd silhouettes crisp. Ship full-res first;
   drop to half-res only if the frame cost warrants.

Dither must be **spatial-only** (IGN over pixel xy). Explicitly *no* blue-noise-needs-temporal, no
frame-indexed rotation — those look right only under TAA and would shimmer here.

## 5. MSAA integration specifics

- **AO is computed and stored single-sample** (per *pixel*, not per *sample*). AO is low-frequency;
  per-pixel resolution is standard and correct under MSAA — MSAA still resolves geometric edges in the
  colour pass exactly as before; AO adds no geometric edges of its own.
- **The forward (multisampled) colour pass samples the single-sample AO by pixel coordinate**
  (`floor(frag_coord.xy)` / screen dims → texel). Every covered sample of a pixel reads the same AO
  value. Binding a non-multisampled texture into an MSAA render pass is legal and normal.
- **Edge behaviour.** The resolved depth is *nearest* (front surface), so an edge pixel's AO is the
  foreground's; background samples of that edge pixel read foreground AO over a 1-px band — low-freq,
  invisible in practice, and the bilateral blur's depth weighting keeps AO from bleeding across the
  gap. Acceptable; no haloing beyond ordinary SSAO.
- **Coverage.** AO is derived from the **opaque** prepass depth, so it lands on terrain + opaque
  objects + A2C foliage (which writes prepass depth). **Water is excluded** (transparent, drawn after;
  it keeps its sky-vis-scaled ambient + env reflection). 2D/UI is never touched.
- On the **1× path** (MSAA off) everything is single-sample already; the normal resolve is skipped.

## 6. Compositing — combined AO + directional ambient

Add the AO texture (Stage 2: + bent-normal texture) to the shared `group(0)` frame bindings, next to
sky-vis (`@binding(10)`), so terrain + objects sample it the same way. In the ambient term of
`terrain.wgsl` / `shading.wgsl`:

- **Combined occlusion:** `ao = gtao_ao * sky_vis_ao(xz)` (screen-space near/mid × baked far/large-
  scale). Multiply is the right model — independent occluders. Apply to the **ambient (indirect) term
  only**, never the direct sun (AO on direct light is the classic over-darkening artifact; direct
  occlusion is the shadow maps' job).
- **Directional ambient (Stage 2):** replace `sky_irradiance(n)` with `sky_irradiance(bent_normal)`,
  still × `ao`. A shaded slope near an occluder now samples sky irradiance from the *open* direction →
  it reads as shaped, not flat. This is the "definition on shaded terrain" payoff, and it reuses the
  already-landed SH ambient. The bent normal is view-space; rotate to world with `inverse(view)` (or
  carry a world-space bent normal out of the pass).

Sky-vis has no bent normal (its Stage-2 refinement), so for terrain the SH sample uses GTAO's bent
normal where GTAO has coverage and the geometric normal elsewhere — GTAO's is the finer signal.

## 7. Stages

> **Stage 1a landed (2026-08-03): the MSAA normal resolve.** `NormalResolve` in `gfx3d/mod.rs`
> plus `gfx3d/normal_resolve.wgsl`, mirroring `DepthResolve`. Built only when
> `sample_count > 1`; sized alongside the prepass normal target; exposed as
> `Gfx3d::normal_sample_view()` (`None` at 1×, where `normal_view()` is already single-sample).
>
> It is **deliberately not recorded per frame yet** — nothing samples the resolved normal
> until the GTAO pass exists, and a fullscreen pass with no consumer is per-frame GPU cost for
> nothing. `NormalResolve::resolve()` is ready for GTAO to call. Same "present, deliberately
> unwired" shape the compute skin bake uses.
>
> The sample-0 choice is pinned by a test that fails if the shader is changed to average raw
> texels — verified by making it average and watching the test fail. That mistake looks *more*
> principled than the correct code, which is exactly why it is worth a test: oct codes wrap, so
> averaging two samples across the fold points nowhere near either normal.

1. **Scalar GTAO + bilateral blur, composited × sky-vis onto ambient.** — **LANDED 2026-08-03.**
   MSAA normal resolve (sample-0), compute pass, spatial denoise, `@binding(11)` AO, multiply into
   the ambient of terrain + objects. Debug view (raw AO greyscale, like sky-vis). ImGui: enable,
   radius, strength, slice/step counts, blur width. **This is the bulk of the visible win.**

   > Wired in the order §1a demands: dispatches first, then `@binding(11)`, then the consumers.
   > `Gfx3d::render_gtao` records the (nearest) depth resolve, the normal resolve, the GTAO
   > compute and both blur dispatches, between the prepass and the forward colour pass. Gated by
   > `Engine::AoSettings` → `WgrGtao` inside the existing `WgrRenderParams` block — the plan asked
   > for a `wgr_set_gtao` setter, but that block already IS the struct-based answer to positional
   > args and its own comment forbids new setters, so the knobs ride it instead. Default OFF;
   > `WGR_GTAO=1` / `WGR_GTAO_DEBUG=1` boot it on, and the gate is echoed as
   > `Wgpu: gtao gate:` at startup. Shadows tab hosts the controls, directly under sky-vis.
   >
   > **Two corrections to what was already committed**, both found by building the consumers:
   >
   > - The per-slice integral multiplied by a global `n·v`. That is not GTAO's normalisation, and
   >   it darkens *unoccluded* ground by the cosine of the view angle — flat terrain would have
   >   faded out toward the horizon and read as fog. Replaced with the real thing: project the
   >   normal into each slice plane, weight by `|n_proj|`, integrate from that slice's own gamma.
   >   Pinned by a numeric test asserting the unoccluded result is 1.0 at six view angles.
   > - `AO_FORMAT` was `R8Unorm`, which is **not a core storage-texture format**. The AO texture
   >   and both bind-group layouts naming it came back invalid, and the symptom surfaced a frame
   >   graph away as `TextureView is invalid` on the shared camera bind group. Now `R32Float`.
   >   The naga-only shader tests could not see this; a headless-device test now builds the real
   >   resources and reads the AO buffer back, which is what catches this whole class.
   >
   > Grass is deliberately NOT a consumer yet. It writes prepass depth/normals so its AO exists,
   > but thin blades are the case most likely to look wrong, and the plan scopes Stage 1 to
   > terrain + objects. Water stays untouched as specified.
   >
   > **Needs eyes:** the raw AO debug view on a real island. Nothing below is worth tuning until
   > someone has confirmed the buffer looks like ambient occlusion.
2. **Bent normal → directional SH ambient.** — **LANDED 2026-08-05** (`6cefd0b`). Bent normal
   accumulated per slice, weighted by the same `proj_len` as the visibility, shared with AO in one
   Rgba16Float target so the bilateral blur filters both with identical weights. Consumed by
   `terrain.wgsl` + `shading.wgsl` via `gtao_bent_normal_world`. Own toggle; debug view mode 2
   draws it as RGB. Sample-0 normal resolve has not shimmered; no proper oct resolve needed yet.
3. **Polish:** — **hierarchical march landed and is DEFAULT OFF** (`6cefd0b`, `4c4cae5`).
   `gtao_depth_mips` builds a linear-view-Z chain (min-reduced = nearest surface; the Hi-Z pyramid
   next door is min-over-reversed-Z = *farthest*, correct for culling and backwards for AO).
   It works, and it flickers: which surface wins a coarse `min` changes abruptly as geometry enters
   the block, and there is no TAA to absorb that. Blending neighbouring mips — the textbook fix —
   made it markedly worse, because a coarse min-reduced texel and a fine one describe different
   surfaces, so lerping them yields a depth matching no geometry. Kept behind `AoSettings::maxMip`
   (default 0) rather than reverted, with the reasoning in `gtao.wgsl`, because the next person
   will have the same idea.
   Still open: multi-bounce curve, half-res + bilateral upsample, thickness tuning, **and measuring
   the frame cost**, which has never been done.

## 8. Plumbing / files

- `gfx3d/` (or a new `ao/` module): the normal-resolve pass (MSAA-only, mirror `DepthResolve`), the
  GTAO compute (`gtao.wgsl`), the bilateral blur (`gtao_blur.wgsl`), the AO texture(s) + their views.
- Inputs bound: `depth_sample_view` (nearest-resolved depth, already built) + the resolved single-
  sample normal + the frame UBO (projection constants, `inv_view_proj`, screen dims).
- `shaders/frame.wgsl`: `@group(0) @binding(11)` AO texture (+ 12 for bent normal in Stage 2) + a
  `gtao_ao(frag_coord)` / `gtao_bent_normal(frag_coord)` helper; extend the `CameraGroup` layout +
  both bind builders + `lib.rs` threading (same pattern the sky-vis `@binding(10)` used).
- Consumers: `terrain.wgsl`, `shaders/shading.wgsl` ambient — `ao *= gtao_ao(...)`, Stage 2 swaps the
  SH normal. Water untouched.
- Frame order (`lib.rs`): prepass → (MSAA) depth resolves + **normal resolve** → **GTAO compute** →
  **GTAO blur** → forward colour pass (samples AO). GTAO reads resolved single-sample targets, so it
  slots in right after the existing resolves.
- FFI/ImGui: **use a struct-based setter** (`WgrGtaoParams` + `wgr_set_gtao`, like `WgrSky`/
  `WgrTonemap`) — the sky-vis feature already ate two positional-arg ABI bugs; a struct kills that
  failure mode. New `AoSettings` in `Engine.hpp` + a DebugOverlay tab.

## 9. Performance

- Full-res, `S=3 × N=10` + a 6-px separable bilateral blur, once per frame, over an OFP-complexity
  depth buffer is cheap on a desktop GPU — this is 2010-era HBAO math at modern clocks. No temporal
  amortization is the cost of no TAA; at this scene scale it is not the bottleneck.
- Half-res compute + bilateral upsample is a 4× fill reduction held in reserve (§4.3).
- The MSAA normal resolve is one extra tiny pass, and only when `sample_count > 1`.

## 10. Risks / notes

- **No-TAA noise floor.** If `S=3,N=10`+blur still bands on grazing slopes, raise `N` before widening
  the blur (a too-wide blur washes out contact darkening — the very thing we're adding). This is the
  main tuning axis; expose slices/steps/blur in ImGui.
- **Oct-normal MSAA resolve.** Averaging oct codes across the encoding wrap is wrong; use decode→
  average→encode, or sample-0. Getting this wrong shows as sparkle on silhouettes.
- **Depth resolve is *nearest*.** Correct for AO (front surface). Do **not** reuse the *farthest*
  resolve (`depth_resolve_far`, water's) — it would place the AO receiver behind foreground edges.
- **Radius is world-space**, projected per-pixel — keeps AO scale-stable across the wildly varying view
  distances of a flight sim; a screen-space-pixel radius would balloon on distant terrain.
- **Ambient-only application.** Keep AO off the direct sun and off emissive; it modulates the SH/flat
  ambient (and, combined with sky-vis, the same term) — never the N·L or the shadow terms.
- **Compose, don't double-count with sky-vis** near the ground: both darken ambient. Multiplying two
  visibilities is correct (independent occlusion); it will *not* over-darken the way summing would, but
  watch cove-beds where both are strong — the floor (`sky_vis_floor` + a GTAO floor) keeps it off pure
  black.
