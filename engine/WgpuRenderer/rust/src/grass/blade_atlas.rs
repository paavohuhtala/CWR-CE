// GRS-D — procedural blade/flower albedo for the near LOD.
//
// Eight species in a 64x256 RGBA8 texture ARRAY (one layer each), not a column
// atlas: with an atlas the lower mips average neighbouring columns together, so
// a distant fine blade would fade into the flower beside it. Layers mip
// independently.
//
// Generated on the CPU at init rather than shipped as image files: the crate has
// no image decoder, the repo is GPL while the game's own grass textures are
// APL-SA, and keeping it as code means the palette stays tweakable here.
//
// NOTE ON REALISM: this is procedural, so it is detailed but not photographic.
// Real grass albedo carries irregular chlorophyll mottling, insect damage and
// dirt that no closed-form function reproduces convincingly. What is modelled
// here is the structure that actually reads at gameplay distance: the midrib
// crease, lengthwise vein bundles, translucent thinning toward the edges, tip
// dieback, and for flowers a radial petal head.
//
// The blade geometry supplies the silhouette, so this stays opaque — no alpha
// cutout, no discard, and the near colour pass keeps early-Z.
