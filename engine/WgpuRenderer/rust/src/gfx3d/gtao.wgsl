// DEFAULT OFF (params.proj.w = 0 pins every tap to mip 0). Measured against the scene, not
// reasoned about, and the reasoning was wrong twice:
//
//   1. Snapping to floor(log2(...)) flickered, because the level a tap wants scales with camera
//      distance, so it flipped as the camera moved and the sampled depth jumped.
//   2. Blending the two levels — the textbook fix — made it MARKEDLY WORSE. A min-reduced coarse
//      texel and a fine one describe DIFFERENT SURFACES (nearest-in-a-large-block vs this pixel),
//      so lerping them produces a depth matching no geometry at all, which then slides
//      continuously as the fraction moves. A continuous wrong answer beats a discontinuous one
//      only when the endpoints are the same quantity, and here they are not.
//
// The underlying problem is that which surface wins a coarse `min` changes abruptly as geometry
// enters and leaves the block, and with MSAA and no TAA (plan §0) there is nothing to absorb
// that. So the mip march stays available and off: `WGR_GTAO` users can raise AoSettings::maxMip
// to trade stability for reach, and the shipped default keeps the stability.
//
// Cost of leaving it off: the pixel-radius clamp is back to shortening the world radius up close,
// so surfaces brighten somewhat as you approach them. That is the milder of the two artifacts —
// a static bias rather than something that moves — which is why it is the default.
