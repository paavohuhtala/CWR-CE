// Interior sky visibility, Stage 1 (docs/interior-sky-visibility-plan.md §4).
//
// A top-down orthographic DEPTH map of the retained object set over a world box around the
// camera. A fragment whose depth in that map sits BELOW the stored occluder depth has geometry
// above it — it is indoors, or under a porch/canopy — and its SKY AMBIENT is attenuated toward a
// floor. Direct sun and local lights are never touched: sun occlusion is already the cascade
// shadow maps' and the terrain sun-shadow mask's job, and the gap this closes is the ambient.
//
// Two things this module is responsible for getting right, both from the plan's risk list:
//
//   * The ortho origin is SNAPPED to the map's texel size. An unsnapped view resamples the world
//     every frame and the result crawls; there is no TAA here to hide it (which is precisely why
//     the GTAO mip march ended up default-off).
//   * Terrain is not in this map at all — it is not part of the retained instance set the sky cull
//     runs over. That is deliberate: terrain is never "above" the player, and including it would
//     make every hillside a roof.
//
// Stage 1.5 (2026-08-05) samples the DOME, not one direction: a zenith map plus four tilted ones.
// This is what the plan's §3b asked for and §3c deferred on a resolution argument — an argument
// taken at a 256 m box. At the small box these use (64 m half-extent, 2048 texels = 6 cm/texel) a
// 1.5 m window reveal is ~25 texels across, so a tilted map resolves it comfortably. A tilted map
// matters because its rays arrive near-HORIZONTALLY: it can see through a window, which a zenith
// map structurally cannot, at any resolution.
