// WTR-002 — GPU timestamp instrumentation. Encoder-level timestamp brackets around the
// named water-pipeline regions (spectrum/FFT phases, interaction, foam, planar reflection,
// water draw, underwater composite), resolved into a small round-robin readback ring and
// harvested non-blocking one-or-more frames later. The master plan gates any FFT rework on
// these timings existing ("Do not replace the FFT implementation before these timings exist").
//
// Design notes:
// * Uses TIMESTAMP_QUERY + TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS so brackets are written on the
//   COMMAND ENCODER between passes — no pass descriptor changes, and one bracket can cover
//   multi-pass regions (planar clouds = march + composite, the planar mip chain, the split
//   FFT phases). Both features are adapter-gated like `partially_bound`: absent => every
//   method is a no-op and the FFI reports 0 regions.
// * `begin`/`end` take `&self` (the written mask is a Cell) so brackets can be dropped into
//   `render_frame` next to existing disjoint field borrows without threading `&mut self`.
// * Readback never blocks the frame: resolve+copy goes into the frame's encoder, map_async
//   is requested after submit, and results are drained with a non-blocking poll the next
//   time round. A saturated ring simply skips that frame's sample.
// * Regions the spec names but that have no standalone GPU pass yet (SSR, refraction,
//   underwater froxel, caustics) hold reserved indices reporting -1 ("n/a"), so the FFI
//   ABI and the Water-tab rows are already in place when those passes land. Whitewater is
//   rendered as part of WaterDraw, so its cost is intentionally included in that region.
//   SSR + refraction are likewise fragment-shader work inside the water draw; caustics
//   ride the underwater composite shader.
