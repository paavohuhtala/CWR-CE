// water. Rays that pass under a crest cross there; neighbouring rays that pass over a
// trough cross somewhere else or not at all — so the waterline appears as the boundary
// between them, at whatever shape the waves actually have.
//
// The march is ONLY for a submerged eye. A dry eye keeps the flat model, because from
// above the surface you are looking AT the water, not through a volume, and the water
// shader owns those pixels. Marching a dry eye fogged the entire sea from the beach: a
