.SYNOPSIS
    Assemble a Preview 0 release package from an explicitly pinned commit.

.DESCRIPTION
    REL-000 requires a "versioned downloadable build or reproducible release
    artifact". Reproducible is the load-bearing word, so this script refuses
    every input that would quietly make the package unreproducible rather than
    warning about it.

    -Commit is mandatory and has no default. That is the whole point. HEAD is
    NOT automatically the release candidate: renderer work lands continuously,
    and defaulting to HEAD is how a package ends up containing whatever happened
    to be committed that afternoon. Naming the commit forces the decision to be
    made by a person, once, on the record.

    Refusals, each corresponding to a failure this project has actually had:

      dirty working tree      A package built from uncommitted changes cannot be
                              reproduced by anyone, including its author.
      HEAD != -Commit         The binaries on disk were built from HEAD. Packaging
                              them while claiming another commit is the stale-binary
                              failure (36a9d29) with a version number attached.
      ledger invalid          The capability matrix and manifest are derived from
                              the ledgers; publishing them while they fail their
                              own validator publishes claims nothing checked.
      missing binary          Both PoseidonGame.exe and wgpu_renderer.dll, or the
                              package produces Entry Point Not Found on launch.

.PARAMETER Commit
    The commit to package. Required. Must equal HEAD and must be an ancestor of
    the current branch.

.PARAMETER Preset
    CMake preset whose dist/ tree supplies the binaries. Default win-x64-clang-rwdi.

.PARAMETER Version
    Package version label. Default preview0.

.PARAMETER OutputRoot
    Where the package directory is created. Default dist/packages.

.PARAMETER ManifestPath
    Build manifest describing the packaged commit. Defaults to the recorded
    Preview-0 manifest, which normally will NOT match a release candidate: that
    file is TEST-002's evidence and is hashed as such, so a candidate should
    generate its own with write_preview0_manifest.py and pass it here rather than
    overwriting a different ticket's record.

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
    Package what is already staged in dist/ instead of building first. Verified by
    content, never by timestamp -- see the stale-binary note above.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\package_preview0.ps1 -Commit 5b136ca4ba93ca9d026eae2dd8e55c629732a744

        Run a native executable and report its exit code honestly.

        Windows PowerShell 5.1 turns any stderr output from a native command into
        an ErrorRecord, and under $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' that becomes a
        TERMINATING error -- so `git rev-parse` on a bad revision, or a validator
        printing a diagnostic, aborts the script with a NativeCommandError instead
        of reaching the refusal message written for exactly that case. The exit
        code, which is the actual answer, never gets looked at.

        Dropping to 'Continue' fixes the abort but not the noise: git emits a
        line-ending warning per file it touches, and merging that into the output
        stream renders a dozen red NativeCommandError blocks in the middle of a
        SUCCESSFUL package run. A release tool whose happy path looks like a
        stack of errors trains its user to ignore errors.

        So the process is started directly with its streams redirected to files.
        No ErrorRecords are produced at all, stderr stays available for
        diagnostics, and the exit code is read from the process rather than
        inferred.

# Timestamps cannot detect this and neither can hashing against source: both were
# green while the shipped file was a day old. Only content-against-content works.
