"""Compute a Preview-0 ticket's evidence hash.

The ledger requires `evidence_hash` on any ticket that reaches VALIDATED or
SHIPPABLE. Until now nothing produced that value and the validator only checked
it was 64 hex characters — so any invented string satisfied it, and the field
attested to nothing.

This derives it from the ticket's own tracked evidence files, so the hash
changes when the evidence changes and a stale or fabricated value is detectable.
`validate_preview0_ledger.py` recomputes it the same way and rejects a mismatch.

    python scripts/compute_evidence_hash.py CORE-NEG-001
    python scripts/compute_evidence_hash.py --all
    python scripts/compute_evidence_hash.py --all --write   # write them back

Content is read through git's filters (as `write_preview0_manifest.py` does), so
the hash is stable across checkouts with different line-ending settings rather
than changing between Windows and Linux.
