"""Build the near-LOD grass blade layers from a registered source sheet.

GRS-GATE-1 wants a *deterministic processing recipe*: the current blade images
were made by hand, so nothing can rebuild them and nothing can say which source
they came from. This is the replacement. Same input, same output, every time --
no randomness, no interactive step, fixed thresholds and a fixed ordering.

    python scripts/build_grass_blade_atlas.py
    python scripts/build_grass_blade_atlas.py --check   # verify without writing

What it does, and why each step is what it is:

The source is ~20 isolated leaf blades on a transparent sheet. The renderer wants
8 layers of 64x256, OPAQUE -- the blade silhouette is real geometry, so these
supply surface detail only and must not be alpha cutouts (see grass-plan.md).

So each blade is UNWRAPPED rather than cropped. A crop of a curved, tilted blade
carries background down its sides, and the background is dilated photo, so it
would appear as coloured fringing along a blade that should be a clean gradient.
Instead, for each row of the blade the mask's span is found and the albedo across
exactly that span is resampled to the layer width. A curved blade straightens,
which is correct: the geometry provides the curve at runtime.

Row 0 of the output is the blade TIP, because `blade_uv.y` is 0 at the tip and 1
at the root. Getting that backwards puts the dry tip colour at the ground.
