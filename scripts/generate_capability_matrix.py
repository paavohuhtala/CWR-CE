"""Generate the Preview-0 public capability matrix from the ledgers.

REL-000 requires a "works / partial / unavailable / experimental" matrix
*derived from validated ledger records*. The derivation is the requirement, not
a formatting preference: a hand-written capability table is the exact artifact
RND-030 found had drifted, where a plan was recorded as shipped on the strength
of a symbol that was evidence against it. A public release note is the worst
possible place to repeat that, because outside readers cannot check it.

So this reads the two ledgers and writes the matrix. `--check` re-generates and
diffs without writing, which is what CI runs, so the published table cannot
drift from the ledger it claims to summarise.

    python scripts/generate_capability_matrix.py            # write
    python scripts/generate_capability_matrix.py --check    # verify, exit 1 on drift

Status mapping, stated here rather than buried in the output:

    SHIPPED           -> Works          present, complete against its plan, on by default
    PARTIAL           -> Partial        present, with a stated gap
    SHIPPED_DISABLED  -> Experimental   complete but off by default; opt in
    (unbuilt)         -> Unavailable    no implementation

Deliberately parsed line-wise rather than with PyYAML, matching
validate_preview0_ledger.py and validate_renderer_ledger.py, so it runs on a
bare checkout with no third-party packages.
