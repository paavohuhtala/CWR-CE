# Stage the loose runtime asset tree (assets/) next to an app and into dist/.
#
# Some renderer features read loose files relative to the WORKING DIRECTORY rather than out of a
# PBO — the grass system is the first (assets/grass/*.png). A missing asset does NOT fail: the
# renderer silently falls back to a procedural substitute, so the symptom is "my texture change
# did nothing", with no error anywhere. That is the same silent-degradation shape as the stale
# cdylib bug (see wgpu_renderer_stage_dll), and it deserves the same treatment: stage it in the
# build rather than relying on anyone remembering a manual copy.
#
# Until 2026-08-04 nothing staged this. It was documented only as a manual Copy-Item step, so a
# fresh clone built, installed and launched via the supported scripts ran with no grass textures
# at all — and looked like it was working.
